## Reflection: Weekly Activity Tracker

### Were your predictions accurate?
Yes. I guessed that drawing or journaling would have the highest enjoyment, and both ended up at the top. I also thought evenings would score higher, which they did. I wasn’t sure about the most common category, but it turned out to be "learning" after looking at the data.

### What surprised you about your week?
I didn’t expect that short activities like reading or watching documentaries would score so high on enjoyment. I assumed longer sessions like social time would be better, but that wasn’t always true.

### Which higher-order function was most useful and why?
I think `filter()` was the easiest to understand and use. It helped narrow down the data quickly, especially in the custom function where I filtered for low-effort, high-enjoyment activities. I liked that it could be reused with different test conditions.
